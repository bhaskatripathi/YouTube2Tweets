# YouTube2Tweets

## Overview
YouTube2Tweets is an application designed to transform YouTube video content into engaging and informative tweets. This tool leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI technologies to transcribe videos, summarize their content, and generate tweets that are both insightful and appealing.

## How It Works
1. **Transcription**: The application starts by fetching the transcript of a YouTube video using the video's ID.
2. **Vectorization**: Utilizing BERT, a sophisticated NLP model, the transcript is vectorized for nuanced linguistic processing.
3. **Summarization**: The vectorized data is then used to generate concise section-wise and overall summaries of the video.
4. **Tweet Generation**: Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, the application crafts tweets from these summaries.
5. **Display**: All summaries and tweets are displayed in a user-friendly interface, with options to interact and explore the content.
